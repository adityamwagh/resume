% Fully Convolutional Networks for Post-Earthquake Damage Assessment
\HeadingTwo{Post-Earthquake Damage Assessment using Fully Convolutional Networks}
{Tensorflow, Keras $\cdot$ \href{https://github.com/adityamwagh/damage-assessment}{\faGithub}}
\ItemListStart{}
\ItemDesc{Designed fully convolutional networks for multi-task semantic segmentation of building
	components and their damage state using a shared backbone}
\ItemDesc{Utilized batch normalization layers to enable faster convergence and better generalization over real data
	since the data used for the project was synthetically generated using physics based graphical models}
\ItemDesc{Achieved a mAP of 97\% over 5 component classes and mAP of 70\% for 5 damage state classes}

% Bag of Visual Words for finding similar images
\HeadingTwo{Visual Place Recognition using Bag of Visual Words}{OpenCV, Sklearn $\cdot$ \href{https://github.com/adityamwagh/bovw}{\faGithub}}
\ItemListStart{}
\ItemDesc{Computed SIFT features for each image in database and queries using OpenCV's built-in SIFT feature extractor}
\ItemDesc{Employed the k-means clustering algorithm to compute 800 cluster centroids to be used
	as visual words to generate a histogram of visual words in each image}
\ItemDesc{Computed histograms of visual words for all the query images and database images
	and extracted similar images from the database by using the k-nearest neighbours algorithm on the generated histograms}

\HeadingTwo{Kinematic and Dynamic Control of a KUKA Manipulator}{Meshcat, Pinnochio $\cdot$ \href{https://github.com}{\faGithub}}
\ItemListStart{}
\ItemDesc{Designed a robot controller for the KUKA 7-joint manipulator}
\ItemDesc{Computed the forward and inverse kinematic and dynamic parameters of the manipulator}
\ItemDesc{Designed and compared a PID Controller, Resolved Rate Controller and an Impedance Controller for the manipulator}

% Smart Pet Feeder
\HeadingTwo{Smart Pet Feeder}{PBASIC $\cdot$ \href{https://github.com}{\faGithub}}
\ItemListStart{}
\ItemDesc{}
{Developed a smart bluetooth operated automatic feeder with an accompanying android app}
\ItemDesc{}
{Designed an android app to control 3 features of the feeder --- drop food, disable feeder and reset food drop count. }
\ItemDesc{}
{Employed a HC-06 bluetooth module to connect a BASIC Stamp micro-controller to to the mobile app}
\ItemDesc{}
{Designed and 3D printed CAD models of the chasis of the feeder}
